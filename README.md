WORK IN PROGRESS

This repository downloads and analyzes the number authorized requests for dbGap datasets.

The number and type of requests for datasets can be used as one measure of impact of data sharing.

## Example Application
The [RADxAuthorizedRequests notebook](notebooks/RADxAuthorizedRequests.ipynb) analyzes the authorized requests for datasets submitted by the COVID Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics [RADx Initiative](https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/radx) projects:

- [RADx Tech](https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/radx/radx-programs#radx-tech)
- [RADx Underserved Populations (RADx-UP)](https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/radx/radx-programs#radx-up)
- [RADx Radical (RADx-rad)](https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/radx/radx-programs#radx-rad)
