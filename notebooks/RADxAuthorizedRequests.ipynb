MIS-C compromised several organs (e.g. heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal tract), and it can be deadly. Therefore, it is critical to understand who is at risk (e.g. those with allergies). Our long term goal is to improve early diagnosis.   Based on our strong preliminary data, we want to validate our findings in a pediatric cohort. The RADx hub will provide a unique opportunity to do so with the large data available.
